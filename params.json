{"name":"Sublime-todomanager","body":"================\r\nSublime Text 2 Todo Manager\r\n================\r\n\r\n* Sourcecode: https://github.com/tanepiper/sublime-todomanager\r\n* Sublime Text 2 forum thread: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=4491\r\n* Release: 1.1.10\r\n* Author: Tane Piper\r\n\r\nIs available via the package manager for install.  Please note that SublimeTODO\r\n(https://github.com/robcowie/SublimeTODO) is a different package and provides\r\ndifferent functionality (so they won't clash).\r\n\r\nCommands available through the command palate are:\r\n\r\n* Todo: Add/Add at Line/Add at Function\r\n* Todo: List All/Active/Done\r\n* Todo: Open file\r\n* Todo: Purge\r\n\r\nAll have keybindings for Windows, Mac and Linux (untested) and the add functions\r\nalso now include context menu items so you can quickly add at the current location\r\nwith the right click of a mouse.  Windows and Linux commands are done with\r\n`Ctrl+Alt+t` followed by `Ctrl+Alt+<letter>`.  On the Mac commands are\r\n`⌘+Ctrl+t` followed by `⌘+Ctrl+<letter>`.\r\n\r\nAll commands act up on the todo file for the current active tab in Sublime Text 2\r\nand cannot be used on files that are closed or being previewed.\r\n\r\nAdding a todo\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nAdding a todo is done in one simple way, but provides two convenience functions\r\nto speed up input. The first way is to just add a todo `(Ctrl+Alt+t, Ctrl+Alt+a)`\r\n- this takes you through the following steps\r\n\r\n1. Select a piority from A-D, or none\r\n2. Enter the task text\r\n3. Enter the line number `~` of the todo\r\n4. Enter the function name `&` of the todo\r\n5. Enter any projects entries `+` as space seperated entries\r\n6. Enter any contexts entries `@` as space seperated entries\r\n\r\nThe line will then be appended to the bottom of the list.  The two additional\r\nfunctions are Add-at-line `(Ctrl+Alt+t,Ctrl+Alt+s)` and Add-at-function\r\n`(Ctrl+Alt+t,Ctrl+Alt+f)` which autofill the lines or function box depending on\r\nwhich is selected.  The function name is always the block of code you are in.\r\n\r\nViewing and filtering todos\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nViewing todos is done with the following commands:\r\n\r\n* List All `(Ctrl+Alt+t,Ctrl+Alt+j)`\r\n* List Active `(Ctrl+Alt+T,Ctrl+Alt+l)`\r\n* List Done `(Ctrl+Alt+t,Ctrl+Alt+k)` commands.\r\n\r\nWhen you view a list, you can navigate up and down the items.  Pressing enter on\r\nany item will present the item menu, with the following options\r\n\r\n* Toggle done status - Change the todo display from active to done, or vice-versa\r\n* Edit - Edit the todo in raw mode, a text box with the full todo item\r\n* Move - Move the item up or down the list, you will be presented with Up or Down options\r\n* Delete - Delete the item from the list, you will be asked to confirm this\r\n\r\nTo filter items, when you have a list open the command palate allows further\r\nkeypresses.  For example if you have the line:\r\n\r\n  `* (A) Finish off refactoring ~45 +MyProject @refactor @release`\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to find this item by it's line number you would type `~45` and the\r\nlist will be filtered to display only this item, or all items with a `~45` next\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nPurge done items and opening files\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nPurging done items `(Ctrl+Alt+t,Ctrl+Alt+p)` removes all done items from the todo\r\nfile.  You will be asked before you want to do this.\r\n\r\nOpening the file `(Ctrl+Alt+t,Ctrl+Alt+o)` opens the file as a plain text file to\r\nbe edited in Sublime Text 2\r\n\r\nFile location\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nIn the settings file, you can change the `todo_home` option, currently set to none.\r\nThis is the location you wish to save the files - it might be somewhere like a\r\ndropbox folder.\r\n\r\nThe default folder is `$HOME/.todomanager`\r\n\r\nFiles are kept in the name format 'todo-<filename-md5>.txt' base on the current\r\nactive file - this means you have a todo per file.  If you want the contents of\r\nthe todo file, it's best to just open it via the command.\r\n\r\nFuture features\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n* UI for changing priority\r\n* Search over todo file contents\r\n* List all todo files\r\n* Provide way to mark source with todo information\r\n* Support for start/end dates in todos, with filtering","tagline":"A simple ToDo list manager","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
